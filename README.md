# Relabeling and Rescaling
Suppose you have a set of variables with variable labels that indicate some common scale (e.g. millions).
    "Cold variable [millions]"
    "Hot variable [millions]"
The code rescales the variables (into e.g. billions) and allows to quickly change the variable labels to:
    "Cold variable [billions]"
    "Hot variable [billions]"
